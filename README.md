# odin-recipes
This is the first project of The Odin Project that I am going to be doing.

It tests me on the absolute barebones basics of HTML and I am looking forward to getting started!

The basic web page I am going to be presenting in this project is going to be a recipe of sorts. As of right now  I am not sure what the recipe will be of, but it sure as hell is not going to be banana pancakes.
